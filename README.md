# PCF Knowledge Depot

Notes and articles around PCF ops/apps tribal knowledge (hints, best-practices and hacks) that have not yet been documented or publicly shared with PCF customers.

Ideally, this would be a temporary repository for such material before it gets published either as part of PCF Documentation or as a Pivotal Knowledge Base article, or before it gets submitted as a PR to the appropriate git repository. Once that is done, the corresponding document in this repository should be updated with a note and a link to the new documentation/article.
